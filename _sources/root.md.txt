# QuickStart PyTorch

A collection of my notes that I used to learn PyTorch. They serve as a reference manual and a learning resource to those looking to grasp the fundamentals and become productive quickly.

> This guide seeks to cover the 20% of information you will need 80% of time while using PyTorch. This is still a work in progress, and will cover basics of the `torch.nn` module and some basics on how to use backprop / autograd in torch.

Feel free to begin what ever suits your interest, depending on your level of comfort from the index below. If you are new to PyTorch, I suggest the following order,

1. [](pytorch.tensor-manual.md)
2. [](pytorch.image-manipulation-manual.md)
3. [](pytorch.dataloader-and-dataset-manual.md)
